## Welcome to my GitHub

I am from a small city in Bangladesh, came to Canada in 2018 to build a Career in Web Development. From my highschool I was fascinated 
to learn computer technology, I used to love mathematics, and I found at the end of the day it is all about making a formula which make some task easier. 

During 2 year education in college, I have learnt pragramming languages such as JavaScript, Java, PHP, SQL and more. Further, I go deeper into some cool frameworks like Laravel, ReactJS, ASP.NET. In my github repositories I pushed some of my course work and sideprojects. My learning cycle is prgressive and I am improving day by day. 

Please reach out to me if you have any questions about my work.
Thank you
