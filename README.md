## Welcome to my GitHub
I came to Canada in 2018 for my higher education and completed the IT Web Programming Diploma in June 2021. From my highschool I was fascinated to learn computer technology, love to solve mathmatics problems by using various formulas.

During 2 year education in college, I have learnt languages such as JavaScript, Java, PHP, SQL and more. Further, I go deeper into some strong libraries and frameworks like Laravel, ReactJS, Asp.net. In my github repositories I added some of my course work and sideprojects. 
Please reach out to me if you have any questions about my work.

#### Thank you
